                        The volunteers in our community work hard around the clock to consistently bring new features and create the best A320neo possible.
                        Let's take a look at some of the features the A32NX has to offer!

                                Every display in the A32NX is programmed to extreme accuracy,

                                taken by our team of real-world pilots and maintenance personnel.

                            The sound set included with the A32NX has recieved very high praise from A320neo pilots, ground workers and simmers alike.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Entirely recorded from the real aircraft and Including a wide variety of unique effects like an entirely dynamic PTU (power transfer unit) sound simulation,
                            it is sure to bring the entire aircraft to life in your simulator.
