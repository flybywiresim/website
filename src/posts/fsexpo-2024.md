On the weekend of June 22nd and 23rd, 2024, the FlyByWire team descended upon Las Vegas to show our latest development and progress to the Flight Simulation enthusiasts who visited FlightSimExpo 2024. FlightSimExpo has been the largest Flight Simulation-related expo in the Americas for years and attracts all the big names in this space, including Microsoft.

This year we were able to get a double-sized booth close to the center of the exhibition hall where people could fly both the A32NX and the A380X. We also had a 45-minute slot on the FSElite stage to showcase the latest development of our A380X project. Our team of 8 very dedicated volunteers had a great time managing these activities and talking to all our visitors.

## Hands-On With Our Aircraft and Chatting with the Team

With a large team spread across the world, conferences like this are the perfect opportunity for our team to meet each other and to meet everyone interested and supporting our community. For the team, people from both Europe and North America joined this event and we had a great time hanging out in the Entertainment Capital of the world, with all its lights, shows, events, *heat* and great restaurants.

For our booth, we brought over several ideas and the actual marketing material from our [FSWeekend 2024 presence](/notams/fsweekend-2024/). We did improve the use of our backdrop this time to make it easier to manage and set up, as well as provide a cleaner design. The extra space we had at FSExpo this year allowed us to create two setups, just like at FSWeekend. This allowed all our visitors to fly both the A32NX and the A380X projects in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2022.

With the size of the booth, we were also able to host a lot of visitors who wanted to catch up with us on the progress of both projects. It was a joy for us to meet all our fans and feel the support from all of you. It is amazing for our team to represent the organization and feel how well the community likes us and how much anticipation exists for the A380X project.

We had to ration our stickers the first day as so many people were coming by and were interested in taking them (exactly why they are there!). All the streamers that came by and tried flying the A380X shared their experience on their streams or follow-up videos, so make sure to check out your favorite channels!

## A380X Full Flight and Live Commentary

FlyByWire Simulations also took the opportunity this year to go on the [FSElite](https://fselite.net/) stage which was located in the exhibition hall. We had a great video of a full flight in the A380X from San Francisco to Las Vegas. The video is 45 minutes long and shows the cold & dark start of the A380X all the way to arriving at the gate in Las Vegas.

On stage, we first gave a brief introduction on who FlyByWire Simulations are and what our goals are. This was followed by four of our team members giving live commentary on the video of the A380X flight and answering questions from the audience. This allowed us to describe some of the different systems and complexities of managing such a magnificent and large aircraft. Here's the full recording of that presentation so you can enjoy the hard work from our team and the great commentary!

For those that would like to see the live flight video itself in much higher quality, no worries, you can find it [on our Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZBMmapOOJ0).
