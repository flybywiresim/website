## Overview

We are happy to introduce our most feature rich update to our onboard electronic flight bag (EFB) - the flyPadOS 3. We have completely overhauled the user interface with our 
new branding scheme while bringing a new user experience to the table. One of our main highlights to user experience is being the first EFB in flight simulation to offer 
support for multiple languages across the entire EFB. This would not have been possible without the kind support from our community providing translations and reviews.

There are other goodies for our pilots to dive into as well including updated Navigraph support, a new and improved pushback feature with onboard map, lighting presets, and in 
flight checklists! To learn more about what's new and upcoming features keep reading below. 

## New Features

### UX/UI

At FlyByWire we believe in well design integrated user interfaces that bring great quality of life experiences to our users. Since the introduction of our flyPad to MSFS we've 
done away with copying real world operating systems, effectively building a cohesive UI that easily integrates useful features at to the tip of your cursor. Starting up the EFB 
simply requires a click on the screen and you are greeted with our unique dashboard that can seamlessly download your simBrief OFP to display all the information required for 
your planned flight. Everything that's important for your flight is on the new dashboard:

- Shortcuts to take you to where you want to go!
- Flight status and general information including your planned route.
- METAR information customizable with your choice of ICAO (displayed raw or with simple symbology).
- Active and upcoming checklists.
- Pinned Navigraph charts.
- Active failure management.

This user experience extends throughout our flyPadOS to enable our pilots to quickly peruse their OFP, access calculations / charts, and integrate easily with online networks 
such as VATSIM/ICAO.

As you navigate throughout the EFB accessing different features and interacting with them, this iteration of the flyPad now has better state management. It easily remembers the 
pages or tabs with the associated data you have entered, so you can safely switch to a new screen without losing any data.

// Probably include here the following: Failures (new UI?), Navigraph maps changes, etc.
- new fresh themed ui
- better state management - pages remember state (tabs) and data 
- more information about the flight status
- direct shortcuts to important flight pages from the Dashboard (pinnable charts, checklists, failures)
- Direct fuel loading from Simbrief

### Localisation

We are extremely happy to offer support for over 30+ languages onboard our EFB. A first in flight simulation you can now access all the features mentioned above and interact 
with them in a language of your choice! This would not have been possible without the help of over 200 contributors and those who have offered to review every corner of the EFB 
for accuracy. A huge benefit of an open source project is our unique position to have our community assist in endeavors such as this. We cannot stress enough how thankful we are.

### Pushback

- Smooth pushback with fine control of speed and direction
- Using buttons or controller axis to steer the tug - rudder axis for direction and elevator axis for speed.
  - Allows users with twisting joysticks to fully conduct the pushback with their stick.
- Pushback map - visual map to conduct the pushback without to the need to change to the external view
  - Turn predication indicator to support precise turns

### Performance Calculation

- Improved UI for the top of decent and landing calculation
Our new pushback page has gone through a UI overhaul with 

### Lighting Presets

We know that starting a flight in a cold and dark state means you have a lot to do before you can get off the ground and climb into the sky. As a small quality of life feature 
we have included fully customizable interior lighting preset. You can set your virtual cockpit with the lighting setup you desire and instantly load that preset in "one click"! 

Need to step away for a moment but want to quickly transition your cockpit for night operations? Simple press the "Load Preset" and be on your way.

### Checklists

We've included essential interactive checklists accessible via its own tab in the left menu. The dashboard on the EFB also smartly recommends the correct checklist based on the 
stage of "flight" you are currently in.

The checklists page will also display what checklist you currently have active and what checklist you have yet to complete. You can use your mouse to click on each line item, 
or simply use the "mark item as complete" button at the bottom of the page. If you would like to utilize your hardware we have some easy to use LVARs for those of you who can 
write to those.
