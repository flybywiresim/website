## Working Title

After a lot of hard work, we have finally completed the first version of our custom FMS.

This update brings significantly more stable flight plan editing capabilities, support for RF and VM legs, entirely custom LNAV path prediction and guidance loops, a completely re-worked, 100% from scratch ND using extremely accurate data and references, going as far as replicating real-life symbol data limits and error messages.

This exciting update is only the beginning of what is to come - we are already doing heavy development of the second version of this system, which includes support for very long awaited features. More previews on this soon.

**Please note:** users currently on Stable or Development releases might notice some changes that affect how they interact with the FMS. We have prepared a documentation page for easing the transition, as well as a known issues page for this new system.

- [Known Issues](https://docs.flybywiresim.com/fbw-a32nx/feature-guides/cFMS/#known-issues)

This effectively brings over the Experimental branch to the Development version, which means we recommend users switch to the Development version as bug fixes and improvements towards this functionality will only happen there.

A huge thank you to the developers below for all the work put into this.
